# Amazon Rekognition Face Detection with Age Difference between Photos  

  In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports an estimate of 460,000 children go missing every year. Anywhere from 89 to 92% percent of all missing persons are found either dead or alive. This still leaves many people as still missing, of which several are children uner the age of 18. Someone's mssing child could be anywhere out in public, but nobody could know. 
 
## Project Introduction
  This project will look to see if the Amazon Rekognition machine learning service is effective in matching pictures of children to pictures of their older selves. Can Amazon Rekognition accurately match childhood photos to pictures of the child grown up? How accurate is Amazon Rekognition in matching faces under the obstruction of time and changing appearance?
 
## Hypotheses
  * Amazon Rekognition can detect a grown-up face given childhood photos.
  * Amazon Rekognition has a lower accuracy in face matching under the disruption of age
  * As the age difference between photos increases, the face matching accuracy decreases.
